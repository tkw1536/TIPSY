TIPSY ("the software") is an advanced inspector for Pathbuilders produced by the [WissKI](https://wiss-ki.eu) software.
The current version you are using exists for demo purposes only.
It is tested on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) only.
It is explicitly <b>not</b> tested on Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, and some functionality is unavailable.

<Embedded>
    Please be aware that TIPSY has been preloaded with a specific (external) pathbuilder to inspect.
    TIPSY neither controls nor endorses this pathbuilder, its' contents, or the embedding website.

TIPSY is made available to you free of charge given you comply with the following terms and conditions:

TIPSY provides functionality to export the created visualizations.
You are granted a license to use the exported visualizations, provided you add the following attribution notice to any document, presentation, poster, image or other medium in which it appears:

<code>
    <Copyable>
        Created with <a href="https://tipsy.guys.wtf/">TIPSY</a> provided by <em>Tom Wiesing</em>.
    </Copyable>
</code>

You also agree to use the visualizations created by TIPSY by using built-in export functionality, and only falling back to using screenshots when necessary.  
This clause does not apply if you chose to show the entirety of the TIPSY user interface (including header and footer), for example during screen sharing sessions and the like.

Please also be aware that even though the code to this project is open source and you may inspect it to your heart's content, the source code does not have a license. 
This means that you may not publicly perform, create derivative works of or distribute this code.
