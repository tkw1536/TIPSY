# A SIP of WissKI

<!-- spellchecker:words SPARQL -->

WissKI is a system that enables users to represent data about any kind of objects using a formal ontology in an an RDF/SPARQL database.
WissKI does not fix the ontology.
The exact data model can be specified using the so-called Pathbuilder.

A typical WissKI use case is recording of objects in a scientific university collection.
Here the ontology used is the conceptual reference model developed by the international council of museums.

SIP stands for Supreme Inspector For Pathbuilders.
It is a tool adjacent to WissKI to inspect and visualize pathbuilders[^1].

This document is meant only to document the functionality of the SIP system.
It assumes basic knowledge about pathbuilders and the WissKI software. 
For a more thorough introduction to data modeling in WissKI, see [TODO].
